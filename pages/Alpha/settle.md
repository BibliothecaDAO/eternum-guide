#### To enter the game you must settle (aka stake) your Realm(s) into the contracts. 

1. Head to your 'Empire' page

2. Navigate to 'Get Started'

3. Add at least one Realm (5 max) and click 'Mint Realms' (this will also add the approval of all game contracts)

3. Sign the command in your tx cart and approve in your StarkNet wallet

4. Once approved, the mint page will update to the settling page (if you navigate off, simply click 'Get Started' again). Check the boxes next to your Realm(s) to settle, and then click 'Settle Realms'

6. Sign the command in your tx cart and approve in your StarkNet wallet

7. Your Realm(s) will be settled as soon as the transaction is approved and you will receive:

**Per Realm**
- 10x $LORDS
- 1x day of resources directly in your bank
- 1x defensive army
- 1x attacking army

:::note
This initial bonus is a one-time occurrence - if you unsettle and settle again, you will not get it again.
