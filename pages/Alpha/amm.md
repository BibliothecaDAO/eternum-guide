Click the 'Bank' button in the menu on the left side of the screen. A new screen appears with the resource markets shown in the right panel, and your orders on the left. Notice the 'Swap' button is highlighted indicating you want to trade resources, and the toggle switch is set to Sell indicating you want to sell your resources for $LORDS.

Resource markets in the left panel are ordered from the most commonly occuring to the least. Below each resource is the quantity of the resource that you own. Next to it is the price for one unit of the resource in $LORDS, and the 24hr change in price. A small 7-day chart shows if the resource is trending up or down in price.

In the image below the player has 600.411 Wood, the current price of one wood is 0.014 $LORDS, and the price has decreased by 0.03% in the past 24hrs.

## Adding Liquidity to the AMM

Liquidity can be added to any market on the AMM. Players deposit resources and $LORDS into the market in exchange for LP, which entitles them to a share of the fees generated by other players trading through the market.

1. Click the 'Bank' button.

2. Click the 'LP' button, and set the toggle to 'Add LP'

3. Click ‘Add +’ and select the resource(s) you want to add liquidity to. Enter the quantity of resources you want to deposit. Notice you must deposit the equivilent value in $LORDS when depositing resources. $LORDS quantity is calculated for you in 'Total Lords to Spend,' so ensure you have enough $LORDS to pair with the resources.

4. Click 'Add Liquidity'

In this case we remove 39.868 LP and will receive 30.777 $LORDS and 368.036 Gold.
