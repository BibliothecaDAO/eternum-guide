# Armies

1. [Military Buildings](./amm#Military-Buildings)
2. [Train Defensive Armies](./amm#Train-Defensive-Armies)
3. [Train Offensive Armies](./amm#Train-Offensive-Armies)

There are two types of army: Defensive and Offensive. Each realm can build a single Defensive army, which is used to protect the realm against enemy raids. If your realm is raided there is a cooldown period before it can be raided again. This gives you time to rebuild your Defensive army if it has been damaged. Defensive armies cannot travel or raid. Each realm can build multiple Offensive armies, which are used to raid enemy realms for relics and resources. Note that Offensive armies cannot attack realms of their own Order.
