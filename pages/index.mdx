# The Lords' Guidebook 

**Realms: ETERNUM**

This is a live alpha version of Eternum. We are dripping features as they are implemented for Lords to join in on the testing to help steer us in the direction of the launch build. 

Currently the systems that are in place are: minting Realms, labor and production, trading, caravans, roads, and hyperstructures. 

Note: this is an alpha being built in real-time - this is not the final alpha.
