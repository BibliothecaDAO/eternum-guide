# Raiding

#### Chosing a Realm to Raid

1. You can find a realm to raid by searching for it. You can find realms based on specific resources, order, rarity etc. The default filters are settled and raidable. Click on the realms tab, then all realms, and then choose filters of your choice and scroll through your selections.

As you are searching for realms to raid you can see 3 useful pieces of information and take 2 actions.

###### a) Resources in vault.
###### b) Defending army strength. (Hover your cursor over the shield icon)
###### c) Whether they own their relic (Self Sovereign) or they have already lost it (Annexed)

You can also click 'Travel to Raid' which will bring up a menu that allows you to send your armies to that realm or 'Fly' which will center your screen on that realm in the atlas.

2. You can also find a realm to raid by going to your empire page and looking to see if anyone has attacked you for resources or taken your relic recently. You can also see if previous attacks of yours failed and raid the realm again to complete the job.

There are filters at the top of this realms page to help you sort through the vizir reports.

#### Traveling

1. Once you have chosen a realm to raid click 'Travel to Raid' to bring up your army selection screen.

2. On this screen you will see several useful pieces of information: 

1) Realm name
2) Army relative strength (Weak, Strong, V. Strong)
3) Army exact strength (if you hover your mouse over the shield icon)
4) The length of time it takes for your army to travel to the selected realm

 Pick your army that best matches up against the enemy army and click 'Travel'. This will queue a tx in the cart which you can sign to put your army in motion. You can also choose to send multiple armies to the destination realm at once. Click 'Travel' for all armies you want to send and then sign one signature for the batch of txs.

#### Raiding

1. When your army arrives at the destination realm you will see a button that says 'Raidable'. 

*NOTE: This button can depend on factors that may not always be obvious e.g. the realm must be settled, have a minimum of 25 resources before it can be raided etc. These things are bound to change as the game progresses so if you're not able to raid a realm and are not sure why feel free to ask in Discord.*

2. If you can't remember where you've sent your armies to you can click on the 'Empire' page and sort by 'Army Travel' to see the last locations you've sent armies to and the estimated time of arrival.

3. When you click the 'Raidable' button you will go to the battle screen. If you have multiple armies stationed at this realm you can select which army you want to use with the drop down menu in the bottom left beneath your army stats. Each realm has a cooldown before it can be raided again so choose wisely. Click 'Plunder!' and then sign the tx that appears in your tx cart to begin the battle.
