# Trading Resources & Food

There are two types of offers, open and direct. Open offers are open to every player in the game to accept, while direct offers are offered exclusively to a Realm. The advantage of the latter is that you can trade with yourself if you need to disperse your resources/food across Realms, or you can make strategic trades with other Realms of your order via off-chain coordination (or onchain via the World Chat).

Note: in the future there will be Banks which will allow for quicker trading/purchasing of resources and food, but will incur a fee. This will be implemented soon. 


## Creating offers

1. Navigate to manage Realms, select a Realm, and click on Trade.

B) Direct Offer: If you want to create an offer for a specific person to accept (whether it’s between your own Realms, an ally from the same order, or a cross-order deal), follow these steps:

- Input the amount of resources you are offering to give for what you are wanting to receive
- Click ‘Make Direct Offer’
- Select the Realm you are creating the offer for (you can filter via Order, Realm ID, Name and Distance)
- Click ‘Next Step’
