# Realm Lords

To participate as a Realm Lord, you must own at least one Realm. 

---

## The Miner
**Objective**: Farm resources and earn $LORDS with minimal time/effort

**Rewards**: Resources, $LORDS

The Farmer takes the strategy of the least amount of time and effort, but in doing so they miss out on their full harvesting and earning potential. 

They do not spend their farmed resources on buildings, attack or defence, and simply allow their raidable vault to be an easy target. 

This means it is likely that they’ll lose 50% of their total resources, but they simply farm the resources that haven’t been pillaged.

They then have the option to hold said resources or trade them via the AMM for $LORDS.

For each Realm they have settled (staked), they also earn 25x $LORDS per day (subject to change as voted on by the DAO).

## The Defender
**Objective**: Defend their Realms resources

**Rewards**: Up to 50% more Resources

The Defender is determined to claim their entire harvest of Resources, no matter the cost. 

They will strategically spend Resources on building a Defence Army on their Realm(s) that they believe will be targets of Raids.

If done effectively, they will be able to claim up to 50% more Resources if their Defence Army defeats any Realm Lord attempting to raid their Vault.

The rarer the Resource the Realm produces, the higher chance the Realm will be targeted by other Realm Lords.

## The Attacker
**Objective**: To pillage Resources from other Realms

**Rewards**: Free Resources (minus cost of war)

The Raider is an ambitious and aggressive player. They want more Resources than they are producing and they don’t want to buy them on the market. 

They will spend Resources on building their Attacking Armies, and the cunning Raiders will do this on their Realms with max Regions and Cities that have the largest capacity for Army Units.

If the Raid is successful, the Raider will receive 25% (subject to change) of the Defenders Vault. 

This strategy is not for the weak-hearted: Army Units killed in combat are gone forever.

## The Guild Master
**Objective**: To make alliances 

**Rewards**: Protection and collective power

The Guild Master acknowledges the Realmverse can be a dark and dangerous place. Instead of taking the weight of the world on their shoulders, they make alliances for collective power. 

Guilds can be formed by any Realm Lord and can recruit members who share a similar philosophy and strategy in the Realmverse. 

This off-chain activity can take place on any platform outside of the game, such as a private Discord server. 

These Realm Lords can then conspire together, create alliances and work towards common goals from targeting particular Realms/Orders to attempting to corner a particular Resource market and beyond.
