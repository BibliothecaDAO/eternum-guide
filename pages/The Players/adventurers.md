# Adventurers (free-to-play)

## The Adventurer
**Requirements**: n/a - free-to-play

**Rewards**: unique game items (tradable for $LORDS via the AMM)

Adventurers are a free-to-play (marginal gas fee to mint and game-play txs) entry in ETERNUM. There are no requirements to mint an adventurer - Realms/$LORDS are not required. 

Upon minting, Adventurers are soulbound to your wallet, meaning only the wallet owner can play with that Adventurer and they are not tradable. That being said, the unique items (in the form of ERC115) can be traded on the marketplace for $LORDS. 

To mint an Adventurer:

1. Connect your MM and StarkNet wallets
2. Customise your Adventurer’s gender and race (this can’t be changed)
3. Mint your Adventurer (marginal gas fee in ETH)
4. You now own an Adventurer that lives on your ArgentX wallet

# Gameplay

## The Quester
**Objective**: Quest across the Realmverse, explore Crypts & Caverns

**Rewards**: Resources, Special Game Items

Adventurers can go on quests across the Realmverse in both active and passive activities. In doing so, they will be able to acquire resources and special game items, which can be used in-game or traded for $LORDS. These resources and items will have a varying rarity and therefore value. 

These explorable areas of the Realmverse will include the 9000 Crypts & Caverns that are spread across the land. 

## The Crafter
**Objective**: Leveling up items

**Rewards**: Crafting unique, rare and valuable items that are tradable

Special NFT items can be crafted with mixtures of resources and other items found in the Lootverse. They exist on an ever-expanding ERC1155 item table, much like the resources do. However, the only way to make these items is by burning the resources gathered in the game. Some of these items will be extremely hard to craft using very rare items.

Crafted items will contain special item statistics which can be used in other parts of the game. An Adventurer will be able to craft an item from their quests, and this item will hold value to a Realm Lord who will pay for it on the open market. Thus, creating an incentive for the Adventurer to craft the item.
