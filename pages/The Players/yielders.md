# The Yielders

The Yielders hold $LORDS and/or Resources, and have two options to choose from to yield more rewards:

## 1. The $LORDS Offeror (single-sided $LORDS staking)

The $LORDS are offered to the Nexus and in return receive run-off from the network's overflow.

**How does it work?**

Players will stake their $LORDS in the Nexus and be rewarded per block according to the previous 24hr trading period. Your reward is calculated according to your share of the offerings.

## 2. Liquidity Merchant (LP token staking)

The Nexus likes to be fed a steady diet of Resource/$LORDS position tokens. In return, it rewards Liquidity Merchants with $LORDS.

**How does it work?**

After creating an LP position, you are returned your position in the form of LP tokens. With these, you can then stake them within the Nexus with one click. From here your position will begin earning $LORDS according to your overall share of the LP position $LORDS pool.

By staking your LP tokens you will earn both fees:

**LP Fees** -> These accrue to your position in the form of Resources and Lords. Impermanent loss is possible while you have positions. Be a weary traveller.

**Nexus $LORDS** -> These are claimable whilst your LP position is staked.
