# Armies

There are two types of armies in Eternum: defensive and offensive.

You can create at most 1 defensive army per realm. Defensive armies protect your vaults from being raided and increase the happiness of your realm. Keep your happiness high or all of your armies will decrease in effectiveness.

Offensive armies are used to raid enemy realms to capture relics and loot resources. Currently it appears you can make as many offensive armies per realm as you want - however, there will be a cap on this number at some point in the future.

There are 8 different types of battalions in 4 categories you can train to fill your armies with. Each army, defensive and offensive, can have 30 battalions of any type, mixing and matching as you please.

| **Building**    | **Tier 1**  | **Tier 2**  |
| -----------     | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Archer Tower**| Archer      | Hunter      |
| **Barracks**    | Soldier     | Paladin     |
| **Castle**      | Cavalry     | Knight      |
| **Mage Tower**  | Apprentice  | Arcanist    |

Each battalion has strengths and weaknesses vs the other types of battalions in a rock, paper scissor style configuration. You can look at your army statistics to get a sense of what is effective against what.

*Please note a bug when purchasing new battalions: currently when you train new battalions they overwrite old ones e.g. if your army has 5 paladins and you train 10 paladins, the new total will be 10 paladins. This should be fixed soon.*

## Military buildings

**Before you can train any battalions you must construct the corresponding military building they are trained in. These military buildings decay and must be rebuilt every 7 days.**

1. Click on the ‘Realms’ page

2. Click 'Your Realms' and 'Construct' on your chosen Realm

5. Navigate to your tx cart, if you have enough resources for the purchase sign the tx and approve it in your StarkNet wallet

6. If you are short any resources, click the 'Reconcile Deficits' button and the marketplace will have an order placed for the necessary amount you require.

7. Clicking 'Buy Resources' in the marketplace will add this tx to the beginning of your list and even though you don't have the resources in your wallet yet the entire tx will go through in order.

*Sometimes the 'Reconcile Deficits' button won't work because of miscalculations of resources when they are exchanged - in those instances you can hover your mouse on top of your $lords amount and check for yourself what you're running low on and add a bit extra.*
