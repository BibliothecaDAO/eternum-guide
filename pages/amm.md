- Click ‘Make Direct Offer’
- Select the Realm you are creating the offer for (you can filter via Order, Realm ID, Name and Distance)
- Click ‘Next Step’

5. You can view your offers under the 'My Offers'. Once they have been accepted by the other party, this is where you will claim them (once their caravan has reached arrived at your Realm).
